    <h1>Flask Application Page</h1>
    <h2>Framework Installation</h2>
    <p>
        Flask was set up by running the <code>pip install flask</code> command within a Python virtual environment.
    </p>
    <h2>Page Development Process</h2>
    <p>
        The application is powered by a single Python script named <code>app.py</code> for handling routes, while the HTML content resides in the 
        <code>templates/index.html</code> file, which Flask renders dynamically.
    </p>
    <h2>Issues Faced and Resolutions</h2>
    <p>
        A key challenge was learning Flask's file structure. This was addressed by adhering to the standard practice of placing HTML files in the <code>templates</code> directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another difficulty was hosting the application. This was resolved by using github.
